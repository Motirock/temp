/*
Rectangle objects are super useful, so here's a simple class for doing so.
This class is also used by the CollisionChecker class.
Please note that just like graphics, its intended use is based around the top-left corner.
This means a Rectangle created like
    new Rectangle(100, 100, 200, 300)
has its left edge at 100, its top edge at 100, a width of 200, and a height of 300
This would also mean that said rectangle's bottom left corner would be at (300, 400)

In theory, you could have x and y represent the center coordinates, but then using Graphics2D would be a bit more complicated
